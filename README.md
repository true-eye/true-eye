**I AM That I AM**

No, I am not an Ivy League Grad. No, I wasn't born and bred to be an entrepreneur. What I am is someone who has developed a deep understanding of what works on the micro and scaled my methods to work on the macro for some of the largest companies today.

I started in a small town at a local state college to play soccer and well that was about it. I soon realized small town USA, Salisbury MD to be exact, needed a digital facelift. Too many companies were operating in the 21st century with a look that they were built in the 18th.

So I began the long journey of redesigning, envisioning and launching companies built for this century. What started off as just myself going door to door, business to business selling services I would YouTube later that night has developed into a global company with partners that are much more talented than me. I have taken the same transparency and work ethic that worked in Small Town USA and have evolved my model to serve corporate giants in 100+ industries. Always evolving, always growing new partners and always the same mission, to take your vision and transform it into a digital reality.
